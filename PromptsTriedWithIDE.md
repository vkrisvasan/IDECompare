Prompt 1:
generate an application to understand the "development and release category" health of a software engineering department looking at the following parameters in the category (a) codebase health (b) development environment i.e developer tools and ci/cd tools for pipeline (c) automated testing health i.e test coverage, test environment, test data setup and (d) frictionless release health. the application should generate synthetic data of jira, git, sonar, semgrep, snyk, developer survey, DORA metrics for as is state analysis for 15 different teams and be able to say which maturity level [Elite, High, Medium, low] each team is based on the parameters within the category. Write the application in a modular, loosely couple way. it is good practice to keep the category and the parameters outside of the python code in a file and build feature in code to encourage addition of new category and parameters. 


Prompt 2:
develop an application with simple UI that provides me all information required to plan by entire day from dusk to dawn. Plan should be related to following parameters (a) weather [http://api.weatherapi.com (b) commute to work and general travel [https://newsapi.org/s/india-news-api] (c) electric power availability [ https://newsapi.org/s/india-news-api](d) holiday impact [https://newsapi.org/s/india-news-api] (e) special events related to sports, politics considerations [https://serpapi.com/google-events-api] (f) technology and research happenings [https://serpapi.com/google-scholar-api (g) trending news in general across world with focus on local news [https://newsdata.io/ (h) market movements [https://serpapi.com/google-finance-api] (i) government regulatory. The plan should be made contextual to me by taking relevant information from me. The application code built in python should be modular, reliable, secure, defensive, follow clean code practices, customisable to modify parameters, take feedback from me and change future plan if i am not satisfied with the components of suggested plan. Application should integrate with actual API. use streamlit. Keep the api URL, api key, parameters in a separate file.
